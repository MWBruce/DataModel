# DataModel
The purpose of this repository is to create a program that collects, stores and recalls data for a selected stock in the most efficient way possible. This will later be used in other models I produce to utilize this information in determining buy and sell.

Please note this will require the curl/curl.h library

This also contains a make file to run the program.
